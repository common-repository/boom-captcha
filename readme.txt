== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Boomcaptcha work? =
Boomcaptcha use the patent pending technology that use encrypted web fonts. The fonts for the challenge text are encrypted, the characters mapping to the encoding are shuffled. For example, вАШAвАЩ glyph is no longer at the location of ASCII 65, instead it is assigned in random location. The challenge text encoding will then be set accordingly, so human will still see the desired вАШAвАЩ and enter вАШAвАЩ, while the spam/bots will see the random encoding and enter the wrong answer.

= Why is Boomcaptcha so much easier to enter the right Captcha challenge? =
Boomcaptcha uses real fonts to display the challenge text so it is scalable and easy to read. When user types the text they will see the same font so it is very easy to match. It is also great for iPhone, iPad and other mobile devices since it is resolution independent, you can zoom in as much as you like and the text will maintain sharp.

= How can I have user type my customized messages? =
You can easily set your customized messages as challenge text in WordPress Boomcaptcha Admin and set the % it should show up. For example, you can set вАШMy great messageвАЩ as challenge text and select 50% then вАШMy great messageвАЩ will show up 50% of the time as the Captcha challenge text. You can set multiple customized challenge text and respective % with Professional version.

= How secure is Boomcaptcha? =
With the patent pending technology Boomcaptcha is much more secured than regular Captcha. The Captcha fonts typefaces variations are endless, making it very difficult for spam/bot programs to use OCR (Optical Characters Recognition) to recognize and the font encryption are changed in real time. The encryption combinations of a font are also limitless, making it difficult to guess the right encodings. We are constantly refreshing the Captcha fonts and encryptions to make it even more secured.

= Why should I refresh the encryption kits and how can I refresh my encryption kits? =
To keep the spammers at bay it is suggested to refresh the encryption kits from time to time. The Free version has only 10 encryption kits and it needs refresh more frequent. Professional versions have 1000 encryption kits and it needs refresh less.

You can login into your account and click on Download Encryption kits, unzip it and copy the encryption kits to your WordPress directory /wp-content/plugins/boomcaptcha/fonts.
